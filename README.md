# LECM-Demons Spectral-Demons Log-Demons
Medical Image Registration Based on Log-Euclidean Covariance Matrices Descriptor
main function: ZL.m

# Instructions for use:
 There are three Buttons and one table on the GUI interface
 The three buttons represent LECM Demons algorithm, Spectral Demons, and Log-Demons algorithm respectively
 The table shows the five types of evaluation measures 
 %%
# Note:
after clicking the algorithm button on the GUI interface, please do not click any key on the current GUI interface until the current algorithm runs to the end, so you can click on the other algorithm button.
